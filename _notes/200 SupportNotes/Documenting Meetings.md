There should be a clarity on why we are documenting a meeting. The most common needs are to refer back (when you forget), make sure everyone is aligned, and have clarity on next steps. Notes can be for the team or for individual purpose. 

It is good to have context of the meeting, issue in focus, multiple solutions, the pros and cons, and the next steps to make it happen.

I use my bullet journal to log meeting notes and transfer decisions to decision document as I use [[Decision Documentation for Communication]]
