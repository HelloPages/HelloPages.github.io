- Earlier you fail, it's better and cheaper. 
- Start design in the ideation phase, even before setting defined goals or commitments. Thinking for visual designs provides enough space to think deeply about complexities and limitations and a better perspective of solving the problems. 
- Consider it as a value addition, as we turn an idea to actionable one, which helps in faster validation.
- [[Design Sprints]] suggests getting feedbacks from initial prototypes.
