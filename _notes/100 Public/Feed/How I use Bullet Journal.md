- I am into [[Bullet Journaling]] since 2018
- The system is extensible and customizable. Also, planning works for me better with analog systems than digital.

## My Journal is a rough notebook

- I jot my ideas. No lettering, calligraphy or penmanship
- [[Rapid logging]] is the method I use, with no paragraphs.
- I use block letters, for readability
- No multi-color annotation, or highlighting

## I use single column layout

- To make things minimal, I use a long [Pennline](https://www.williampenn.net/pennline/quikrite) Note, 20cm x 12cm long notebook, which restricts to building multi-column layouts.

## Index Page is powerful

- I don’t like leaving pages in a notebook, and I am bad at estimating pages per idea.
- BuJo is the first system that recommended me to use an index as a book appendix.
- One title can have multiple related pages
- A one-to-many mapping instead of one-to-one.

## No Monthly logs or Future logs

- While BuJo recommends having a monthly log and future log, I don't follow them. My whole planning is on a weekly basis. But every month, I create a single page, vertical calendar to write 'One line a day journal'.

## Weekly Log, a brain dump

- Every Sunday, I spend some time listing everything I need to get done this week. Work, Personal, Leisure, Travel, Events - everything.
- Every task, leads to more related tasks and I keep listing them.
- I use one letter category tag (K for Kaleyra, L for Little Black Choux, etc) followed by task
- I also skim and go through last week's list, to pick things that are relevant.
- This list is just a brain dump, not an action plan.

## Embrace LNO

- Once I have the whole list, I go through things that are important, high impact, and emergency.
- Earlier I used to follow [[Eisenhower Matrix]], but these days I follow [[LNO Framework]]
- Based on this, I find things I should be doing first, and on specific days.

## Daily Note

- Every day, I pick my task for the day and rewrite them with clear outcomes.
- Events are also added to this, from Calendar, so that there will be more clarity about the day.
- Daily note works as my commonplace book too, as I add ideas, notes, and random thoughts with dash bullets.
