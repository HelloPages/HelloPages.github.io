- There are two main definitions for the problem, 
	1. A matter, or situation regarded as unwelcome or harmful and needing to be dealt with and overcome. 
	2. An inquiry starting from given conditions to investigate or demonstrate a fact, result, or law.

- While the latter is seen as a “scientific” definition of problem-solving, especially product building, we need to go through both types. 

- Identifying the problem and defining it with clarity, is as critical as problem-solving. Also, while setting the appetite or defining the problem, we need to narrow down our understanding of the problem.

- Shorter projects force you to prfioritize the most important feature set. They also get you into the habit of shipping continuously, which creates quick feedback loops with customers.
- The solutiondoesn’t matter if the problem isn’t worth solving.
