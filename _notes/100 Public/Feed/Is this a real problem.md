- There are two main definitions for the problem, 
> 1. a matter or situation regarded as unwelcome or harmful and needing to be dealt with and overcome. 

> 2. an inquiry starting from given conditions to investigate or demonstrate a fact, result, or law.

- While Latter is seen as a "scientific" definition of problem-solving, especially product building, we need to go through both types. 
- Identifying the problem and defining it as critical as problem-solving. Also, while setting the appetite or defining the problem, we need to narrow down our understanding of the problem.
- Shorter projects force you to prioritize the most important feature set. They also get you into the habit of shipping continuously, which creates quick feedback loops with customers.
- The solution doesn’t matter if the problem isn’t worth solving.
