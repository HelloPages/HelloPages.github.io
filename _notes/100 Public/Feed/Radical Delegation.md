- Once we have too many things in our plate, [[Eisenhower Matrix]] becomes less usable, as there are too many things to get done, even after delegating and deleting. 
- Radical delegation is for tasks in two top quadrants of  Eisenhower Matrix - Do & Schedule. 
- Assess each tasks in top two quadrants, and understand the the leverage (High/Low) and who could do this (Only You/Others)
- High Leverage + Only You : Focus Deeply
- Everything else, you delegate, But

		- Delegate and be available when then need
- Provides a great chance to empower team members, and help them grow.
