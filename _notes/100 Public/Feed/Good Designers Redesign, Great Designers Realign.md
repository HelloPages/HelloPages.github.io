For strategic objectives, as a designer, instead of thinking of a redesigning, it is always better to think from a realignment perspective. **The desire to redesign is aesthetic-driven, while the desire to realign is purpose-driven.**

While realigning, consider the following: 
	- Ensure there is a reason.
	- Have a solid clarity on level of realignment 
	- Evaluate the user-switching cost / learning-curve
