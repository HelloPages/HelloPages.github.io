- If you see product in a strategic objective, or focused on user need, you *can* end up on 'realignment', instead of going for redesigning. Redesigning often rely on emotional responses to aesthetics in justifying a redesign.
- **The desire to redesign is aesthetic-driven, while the desire to realign is purpose-driven.**
- While realigning, consider : 
	- Ensure there is a reason
	- Have a solid clarity on level of realignment 
	- Evaluate the user-switching cost / learning-curve
	- Be clear how the realignment reaches user - phased or one-shot
