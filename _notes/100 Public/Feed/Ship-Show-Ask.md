- Ship/Show/Ask - PR with ability to make changes
- Changes are categorized to three
	- **Ship** (Merge to main, without review)
	- **Show** (PR and Merge to Main)
	- **Ask** (PR, then discuss, then merge)
- Best of two worlds
	- Merge your own pull request without waiting for feedback, then act to feedback if/when it comes.
	- It encourages decision making to think about the change that we are making.
