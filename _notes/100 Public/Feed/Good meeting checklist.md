- Don't agree to join a meeting without an agenda. 
	- If not ask the organiser to write one
	- Make sure it is not generic / abstract. 
- If you are the one who is writing agenda, make sure it has these items : 
	- Purpose of the meeting (Objective, Problems to solve etc)
	- Expected Outcome (expected actions, deliverables, decisions)
	- Participants Role (People impacted, level of involvement)
	- Probable issues (Questions, concerns etc.)
	- Process (How, what, what to prepare)
- [[Meetings are not the place to surprise people]]
- [[You don't have to be the first with an opinion]]
