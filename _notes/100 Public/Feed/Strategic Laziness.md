There is no need that things you do has to be hard. Easier way to get things done is *strategically* better. In Ali Abdaal's video, he mentions the RAD system - Reduce, Automate and Delegate.

- **Reduce**
	- Reduce committed projects.
	- Decide on what 'not' to do.
	- Rebalance, check and say no to projects.
	- [[Batching]]
- **Automate**
	- Automate repeating things
	- Build #Systems  that makes it easier
	- Text Expansion in Mac
- **Delegate**
	- You don't have to do 'everything'
	- Delegate, Collaborate
	- Figure out your value, and decide what to do
