- User experience is the overall experience, and it has to be taken into consideration (and hence in discussion) at the product level and not at the feature level. 
- The persona, flow learning curve, expected feedbacks, etc., should be on the product level. 
- Engage all teams in these conversations so that everyone has a clear understanding of the user needs, limitations, and product requirements. 
- Once they understand the user experience intuitively, you don’t need to clarify it at the task level.
