- While building a feature for a product, it is faster if everyone on the team should write their own issues. 
- This makes it easier to understand how clear they abound the end goal, thus setting up the team to do a better job.
- Also, writing their own tasks provide them enough space to think about the problem on a more profound level and come with better approaches or questions about missing parts.
