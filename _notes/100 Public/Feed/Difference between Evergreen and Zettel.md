- [[Evergreen Notes]] is very similar to [[Zettelkasten]], and the core principals are almost same.
- The major difference here is Zettelkasten consider literature notes and permanent notes as a tool for building outputs (academic papers, blogs) while in Evergreen / Digital garden, focuses on knowledge accumulation 

## Zettel
- Fleet notes are made, so that you won't forget
- Literature notes are made, and kept, as knowledge base
- Permanent note summaries multiple lit notes
- And that leads to some kind of output
- Atomic notes are accumulated

## Evergreen
- Ideas as written and added to garden. All notes are part of the garden, and has a potential to be evergreen.
- Notes get modified over time, and 'grows' as you learn more.
- Notes might change drastically, gets archived or deleted.
- Knowledge is accumulated
