Monotone has its own aesthetic appeal. But there is a higher chance that it fails on accessibility due to color blindness. While choosing colors for data visualizations, pick colors across the spectrum. Different hues, tints, and tones. This makes it more accessible for color-blind people. They might not see all colors, but there will be a sense of differentiation between shades.
