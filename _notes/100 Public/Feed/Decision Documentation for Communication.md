For long term projects, without customer level 'release', (Eg While [[Implimenting a design System]]) it is good to have a time based change log. [[Figma]] version control is not that efficient It doesn't provide Version per frame, comparison or search inside push note. Hence we use Google Doc. 

- [[Changelog as a consistent communication tool]]

## Version Numbering

- Two number version system
	- XX.YY
- YY is any changes made in Single Source of Truth
	- Any designer can add it
	- Consider it more as Ship / Show of [[Ship-Show-Ask]]
- XX is bi-weekly design meeting count
	- Objective is to do the Ask part of [[Ship-Show-Ask]]
	- Decisions are made, SST is updated
