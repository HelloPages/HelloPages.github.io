It is good to define designs top-down, as we need to [[Keep user experience discussions at the product level]].Once we have clarity on design, convert those to UX templates. 

Similar to [[Implimenting a design System]], consider UX templates as a single source of truth, for repeated user-goals, actions or experiences. This can help designers to identify goals with similar patterns, reuse similar use journeys, thus reducing product learning curve. Also while create initial designs, or base MVP of product, this encourages reuse of existing patterns and templates. 

This practice helps designers on building [[Interface Inventory]] and on creating a [[Scorecards to Pilot Design System Migration]]
