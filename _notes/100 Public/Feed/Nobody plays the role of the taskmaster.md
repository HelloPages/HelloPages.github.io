- Assign projects, not tasks. There is no need for someone to play the role of a “taskmaster” who splits the project up into pieces for other people to execute.
- Splitting the project into tasks upfront is like putting the pitch through a paper shredder. It too micro information that it leads to disconnection. 
- It's about the right level of abstraction.
