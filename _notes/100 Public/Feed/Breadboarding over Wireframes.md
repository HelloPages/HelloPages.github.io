- I recommend product people to create [[Breadboarding]] over Wireframing, as initial product documentation _especially to interact with designers_. Wireframes are too detailed. This Extra detailing kills the possibility of abstraction. 
- Also, focus on wireframes are more on on-screen interactions (which provides designers less room for creativity) and not the workflow or the user journey (and this leads to estimation errors as [[--Overspecification leads to estimation errors]])
- [[Fat-marker method]] and [[Breadboarding]] are better, faster way of idea interactions. If micro detailing is needed, it is better to go for [[Draw over the screenshot]].
- [[Stop spending time on Wireframing]]
