A Brand is NOT the logo, or identity, or consistency, or product itself. A brand is an individual's emotional feeling about a product, service, or company. It differs from person to person. Once too many people feel the same way about a company/service/product, a [[Brand Tribe]] is formed, that's when it is said to have a brand.
