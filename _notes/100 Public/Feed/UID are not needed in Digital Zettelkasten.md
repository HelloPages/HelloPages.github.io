notetype: feed

- [[Zettelkasten]] recommends having a Unique ID on every literature note made so that it's easier to refer, discover, and hence connect. *I don't do that*
- Reasons are: My Zettel is digital. Hyperlink/WikiLinks will do this job, as it is supposed to do. 
- The File names, hence the hyperlinks, will look cleaner and readable *I don't use UID in my Zettelkasten vs. 2020171833; I don't use UID in my Zettelkasten*
