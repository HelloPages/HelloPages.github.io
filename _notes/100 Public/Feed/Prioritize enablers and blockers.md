Before building a feature, try to understand if the problem is genuinely preventing someone from using the product or a nice to have in their user experience. Ask [[Is this a real problem]]. Check if it's important to be done now, or can be done later. 

Enablers enable new functionality that makes the product more valuable. Blockers are the friction that prevents a user from using your product. We need to remove blocker, and add enablers.
