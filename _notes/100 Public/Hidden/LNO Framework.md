- All your tasks are not created equal. 
- All tasks doesn't deserve your best effort. 
- Task Types
	- Leverage tasks : Do a great job
	- Neutral tasks : Do strictly good job
	- Overhead tasks : Just get it done
- L tasks when energy & focus was high. And N/O tasks when low.
- [[How I use Bullet Journal]]
	- I use up-arrow/dash/down-arrow instead of LNO as I use letters as task categories.
