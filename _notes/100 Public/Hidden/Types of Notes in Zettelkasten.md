- Start with **Fleeting notes**
	-  quick reminders of ideas 
	- terms, jargon, 
	- examples 
	- kindle highlights. 

- Based on Fleeting, create **Literature notes** 
- one idea written in own words
- explained and written to provide context
- [[Atomicity]]

- **Permanent notes** 
	- over multiple lit notes. 
	- It's more like a concept/idea note
	- based on insights from multiple sources.

> Fleets are reminders, Lits are one note about one topic from one source, while permanent notes connects multiple lit notes and creates knowledge, specific to a concept.
