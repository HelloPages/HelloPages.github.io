- Idea behind Basecamp's hill chart diagram. 
- Every piece of work has two phases. **Uphill** phase of figuring out approach and a **downhill** phase of execution.
- The Hill Chart diagram looks like a broad bell curve, with a vertical dotted line down the middle. The left edge is the start, the right end is finish - the left half is figuring out, and the right is executing.
- Every task is mentioned in this hill diagram, based on its progress. 
- Note how the hill shows how the work feels at different stages. The uphill phase is full of uncertainty, unknowns, and problem-solving. The downhill phase is marked by certainty, confidence, seeing everything, and knowing what to do.
