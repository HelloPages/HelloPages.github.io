- How might We
	- Recommended for Decision building workshops
		- rephrasing problems to opportunities before finding the solution. 
- Once the problem is clear and specific, without focusing on the solution, convert the problem statement to a sentence that starts with *"How might we..".* This provides more clarity on the problem, the opportunity.
