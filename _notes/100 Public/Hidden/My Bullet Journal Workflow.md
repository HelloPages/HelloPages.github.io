title: My Bullet Journal Workflow
date: 2021-09-09

For the last three and a half years, I am into Bullet Journaling - a framework for analog journaling, created by [Ryder Carroll](https://twitter.com/rydercarroll) and used by thousands worldwide. It’s not like a planner you get from the store that forces you to follow specific formats. It’s an extensible, customizable, and **_re-hashable_**.

If you are new to Bullet Journal, [the best way to learn is by watching this small official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fm15cmYU0IM). (It’s simple, well explained, and just 5 minutes!) or read the [blog](http://for%20more%2C%20read%20the%20bullet%20journal%20method%20book%20by%20ryder%20carroll./) / [The Bullet Journal Method](https://amzn.to/3aBfSSq) book by Ryder Carroll.

### My journal is a rough notebook

I jot like how I used to take notes while at college. Also, I use one pen to write everything. Two-color annotation, highlighter, etc., doesn’t work for me. To emphasize, I use upper case text or underline.

### One Column Layout
I found ‘setting up BuJo’ a tedious task. For some reason, it never worked for me. These days, I am using Pennline note — a long note of 190 mm X 105 mm dimension, which restricts me from creating anything other than a one-column layout.

### Index Page

Index method made me a Bullet Journal fan. I always had issues with reserving empty pages for an idea. Instead of Page number relating to title, BuJo recommended reverse indexing, one title referring to multiple page numbers.

### Monthly Log

Bullet Journal suggests a two-page monthly log — one for the calendar and one for the monthly task. While I use the calendar to mark all my events, plans, meetings, etc., I don’t create a monthly to-do list. I prefer making it weekly. Instead of the Task page, I use the right side as my “One-line-a-day dairy.”

### Weekly Log + Daily log

My tasks are more tactical and one-time, so I find it easier to list them every week based on priority and time. (In other words, I don’t plan for an entire month). I use a simple checklist to ensure that I have specified 'outcomes' in all areas of life - work, personal, learning and leisure. The same page is followed with Daily logs.

### Workflow 
I don’t have a separate notebook for notes. I use the same journal for client meetings, personal grocery lists, tax details, or investment planning. A new page, add that to Index, [thread](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/bulletjournalist/threading) it, and that’s all.

_For meetings, note metadata like time, date, location, attendees, underline indented outcomes, and subsequent actions._

**Habit Tracker**

I was never successful in building a 'long list of habits'. I usually track one thing, and I do that with a Cross/Empty column on the monthly log. For repeated tasks, like monthly investments, I have a dedicated page (and spreadsheet) that to track the updates.
