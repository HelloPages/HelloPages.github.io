- Left, IAM
	- Identity (Who they are)
	- Aims (What they want)
	- Mores (How they belong)
- Right, POV
	- Purpose (Why we exist)
	- Onlyness (What we offer)
	- Values (How we behave)

- The two columns are purposely set up so that statements in each row align with one another or support each other. 


- i.e., the Purpose should relate to Identity, the offering should focus on aims, and behave should sync with belonging.
