- The Eisenhower Matrix – Urgent-Important Matrix – Helps in prioritising tasks by urgency and importance. 
- The matrix is divided into four – 
	- Top being important, 
	- bottom for not-important,
	-  left for urgent
	-  right for not urgent. 
		- This gives four quadrants NU+I, U+I, U+NI and NU+NI.
-  **Do** what's in Urgent and Important
-  **Schedule** Important but not Urgent
-  **Delegate** not important but urgent 
-  **ignore** what's not important or urgent.
- Ankur Warikoo recommended adding a [[Third dimension to Eisenhower Matrix]], and making it practically easier.
