- Anchoring is a form of [[Priming]] that happens when there initial exposure to a number, and you are anchored to that number, which influences the subsequent judgment. 

> if you are asked to guess (not calculate) the result of 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1, you might guess a higher number compared to your guess of the result for 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8, because the first number in that calculation (1 versus 8) influences your judgment.
