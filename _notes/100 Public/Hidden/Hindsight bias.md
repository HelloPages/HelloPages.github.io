- he **I know it all along** bias. 
- Humans tend to reconstruct stories around past events to underestimate the surprise caused by those events. 
- If the event happens, people exaggerate the probability that they knew it was going to happen. 
- If the event doesn't occur, they recall that they thought it was unlikely.
