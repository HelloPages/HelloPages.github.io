I use Obsidian to manage my personal knowledge, and Jekyll and Github pages to publish them online. 

# Expectation
- Publish my notes from Obsidian
- Not all notes, there are things like personal logs, templates etc
- Bi-directional links should work (Outgoing links under notes)
- No change in markdown file ; No re-write to publish
- Build something that I can maintain

After few search, I found a Jekyll theme called [Simply Jekyll](https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/), which was obsidian friendly with some configuration changes. I forked that theme to build [my website](https://hiran.in), and released the same as a Jekyll theme so that others can use. See demo at [Github Pages](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/), check [Github](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) for code.
