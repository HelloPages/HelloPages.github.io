- People tend to be overweight in recent experiences, and the positive or negative perception of one is disproportionately determined by the last episodes of the entire experience. 
- A vacation that starts bad but has a pleasant ending is likely to be remembered favorably; the opposite sequence may undermine the overall experience.
- Similarly, the last 20 minutes of the movie define the genre to the general audience (thus, commercial films prefer a closed happy ending over open-ended ones). The tail ends with a comedian, or everyone being happy cracking some jokes are usually used in Indian Cinemas to build this effect. [[Peak-End Rule]]
