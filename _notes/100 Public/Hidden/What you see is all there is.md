	- What you see is all there is, 
	- a phenomenon of how people jump to conclusions based on limited information. 
	- They tend to focus on existing evidence and ignore absent evidence. 

- As a result, System 1 offers believable stories based on limited evidence
- these impressions or intuitions can then be endorsed by System 2 and turn into deep-rooted values and *beliefs*. (LOL!)
