- There are two systems of thinking – 
	- System 1  
		-  System 1 is “reaction”
		-  System 1 (Thinking Fast) is the intuitive, reactive way of thinking based on first impression and quick reaction. (Jumping to conclusion),  
	- System 2
		-  System 2 is “analytical”
		- System 2 (Thinking Slow) is about reflection, analysis, and problem-solving. 
- We think that we are rational and analytical, but that's wrong. We use system 1 more often than system 2. 
- *In a way, feeling that we use System 2 more itself results from System 1 thinking. Analyze and you will know you are wrong ;)*
- System 2 only gets involved when we encounter something unexpected that System 1 can’t automatically process. System 1 is accurate at times. But it can make error due to [[Bias]] 
- Also, System 1 sometimes answers easier questions than answering real problem 
	- [[Is this a real problem]]
