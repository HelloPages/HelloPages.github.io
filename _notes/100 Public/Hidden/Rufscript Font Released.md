> Making a font from others handwriting is more to experiment than fun. And what it made so thrill is that, all the glyphs for making of the font are captured from her note book, without her knowledge. My K750 worked as the capturing machine. The font is licensed under [GNU GPL version 3](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html) + [Font Exception](http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl-faq.html#FontException).

> ## Here is the font as [ttf](https://sources.debian.org/src/fonts-rufscript/010-3/Rufscript010.ttf/) and here is its [source sfd](https://github.com/hfactor/rufscript).

> The font is compiled and designed in the latest stable version of fontforge, ([20080927, available as tarball at sourceforge](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fontforge/fontforge_full-20080927.tar.bz2?modtime=1222592596&big_mirror=0)).
