### Devices
I use Mac Book Pro provided by Office for all primary purposes and iPad Pro 2020 for personal requirements. Google Pixel 3a is my only phone, with [Before Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.beforesoft.launcher&hl=en_IN&gl=US) and [95% notifications turned off](https://medium.com/make-time/six-years-with-a-distraction-free-iphone-8cf5eb4f97e3). 

### Reading
For e-reading, I use a 2013 [Kindle Paperwhite](https://amzn.to/3nGZ5nY). [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) is used for e-book management and [clippings.io](https://www.clippings.io/) for highlights. [Raindrop](https://raindrop.io/) is my current read-it-later tool.

### Bullet Journal
I prefer analog tools for planning, as it is easier to maintain. I follow [Bullet Journal](https://bulletjournal.com/pages/learn) since 2015 and uses [Pennline Quikrite](https://amzn.to/2KG9uBJ) along with [TWSBI Eco](https://amzn.to/3h2FLyU) for Bu-Jo-ing.

### Designing
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) are my default tools for raster and vector designing, since 2006. For screen designing, initially I used [Sketchapp](https://www.sketch.com/), but for a while, it's [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) Also, I have [Procreate App](https://procreate.art/) on my iPad, but that's too French for me!

### Note-Taking
Starting from Firebox Bookmarks to Delicious days, I always loved storing links for re-discovery. [Evernote](https://evernote.com/) was my tool of choice until my requirement changed (and Evernote became bulky). For a brief period, I used [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) but introduction to Zettelkasten and Digital garden made me move to [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which stores information as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

I use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) to store my markdown files, and editors like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [1writer](https://1writerapp.com/) along with Obsidian to edit notes. 

### Listening
I like audio books and podcasts. I use [Audible](https://www.audible.in/) and [Storytel](https://www.storytel.com/in/en/) for Audiobook and [Voice app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.ph1b.audiobook&hl=en_IN&gl=US) in case if I need one. For Podcast, I still use [PocketCast](https://www.pocketcasts.com/), and for everything else, there is [YTMusic](https://music.youtube.com/).


### Malayalam Input
Malayalam is my native language, and I write and chat a lot using that. [Indic Keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.smc.inputmethod.indic&hl=en&gl=US) for Android, [Varamozhi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/varamozhi/id514987251)  for iPad, and [Keymagic](https://junix.in/keymagic-with-malayalam/) for Mac are my current choice of tools.
