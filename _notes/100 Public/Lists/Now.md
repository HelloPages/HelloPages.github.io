A page that tells you what I am focused on at this point in their life. Inspired by [Derek Sivers's](https://sive.rs/nowff), [Now Page idea](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Now (as on 09/Dec/2022)


## 2022

### October
'The Travel heals' logic took us to Bangkok and Bali for 8 days. That was a refreshing travel. Nature, food and pools. As I started finding hard to focus on fictional reading, I decided to pick something different from my usual book pattern. I started listening to *Poniyin Selvan*,a 2000+ page long, 5 volume Tamil classic Historical fiction. 

### September
Visiting Milan was a great experience. Thanks to Kaleyra for conducting a leadership workshop, it was a good opportunity to meet many people from the organisation, a great escape for me from the reality.
There is a lot to learn about wines and coffee. (Thanks to Nic, Geoff and Joan). The researches lead me to a new rabbit hole, installation of Vivino app, and owning an Aeropress. 

### August
Yathim* is the word of the year. I [lost both my parents](https://hiran.substack.com/p/update-life-changes) in a span of 32 days. The vacuum is real, so is the shock.

### June
I started sketching. The intention is to observe, and sketch as I travel. A substitute for photography, an alternative/non-written journaling habit.
