A page that tells you what I am focused on at this point of life. Inspired by [Derek Sivers's](https://sive.rs/nowff), [Now Page idea](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Now

- Working on a design system for an enterprise product that needs to scale and support multiple use cases and regions.
- DONE : Building an [[AntiLibrary]] by category and making reading a daily habit. (If any suggestions, do share via [email](mailto:hiran.v@gmail.com) or DM to [twitter](http://twitter.com/hfactor))
- DONE: Restart [Newsletter](https://hiran.substack.com/)
- DONE: Start publishing cleaned-up articles via newsletter and medium. Newsletter for refined content, working notes for half-baked and evergreens, [a telegram channel](https://t.me/hiranlog) for everything half baked - movie review to daily sketches. 
	- Share it via newsletter
- Few long forms to write:
	- DONE: my current bullet journal method
	- Jekyll and Obsidian setup, 
	- on having multiple note
	- decision log for communication. 
- Instead of linking amazon, [[Library]] and [[Movie List]] should have link to review notes. (Which means more writing!)
