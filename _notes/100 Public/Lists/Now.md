A page that tells you what I am focused on at this point of life. Inspired by [Derek Sivers's](https://sive.rs/nowff), [Now Page idea](https://nownownow.com/about). 

## Now

- Working on a design system for an enterprise product that needs to scale and support multiple use cases and regions.
- Building an [[AntiLibrary]] by category and making reading a daily habit. (If any suggestions, do share via [email](mailto:hiran.v@gmail.com) or DM to [twitter](http://twitter.com/hfactor))
- Restart [Newsletter](https://hiran.substack.com/)
- Start publishing cleaned-up articles via newsletter and medium. Newsletter for refined content, working notes for half-baked and evergreens, a telegram channel for everything half baked - movie review to daily sketches. 
- Few long forms to write - my current bullet journal method, Jekyll and Obsidian setup, on having multiple note and decision log for communication. 
- Instead of linking amazon, [[Library]] and [[Movie List]] should have link to review notes. (Which means more writing!)

#### On Jekyll Theme / Website
- Easier image support
- Support `![]` based transclusion 
- New UI
- Add Contact / Mentoring page
