- 'Additive Enablers' and 'Removing Blockers'
	- Enablers enable new functionality that makes the product more valuable
	- Blockers are the friction that prevents a user from using your product.
-  Before building a feature, try to understand if the problem is genuinely preventing someone from using the product or a nice to have in their user experience. [[Is this a real problem]]
- Also, check if this is important to be done now or can it be done later.
- Prioritization is important. What and when to Prioritize is also important.
