- User stories are complex time and resource-consuming 'rituals' built in the early days of software building. 
- There are standards and expected features for common features that we don't have to explain most of them 'in detail.'
- Also, the time-consuming user stories can silo engineers into a  role where they code to the issue requirements instead of thinking about the user experience in a totality.
