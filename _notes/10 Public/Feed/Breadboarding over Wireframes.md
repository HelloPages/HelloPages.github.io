- I prefer Product Managers creating [[Breadboarding]] over Wireframing, as initial product documentation _especially to interact with designers_. Wireframes are too detailed. This Extra detailing kills the possibility of abstraction. 
- Wireframes provides an output similar to Hi-fidelity UI, that it focuses on-screen level interactions, not workflow or the feature. This leaves designers no room for creativity and makes the discovery of an alternative visual solution complicated. 
- Also, [[--Overspecification leads to estimation errors]]. 
- The breadboard and [[Fat-marker method]] give room to designers in subsequent phases of the project. [[Draw over the screenshot]] is another method I prefer as I would urge managers to [[Stop spending time on Wireframing]]
