- The Eisenhower Matrix - Urgent-Important Matrix
- Helps in prioritizing tasks by urgency and importance
- Set Tasks to 4 Quadrants 
	- Top: Important 
	- Bottom: Not-Important 
	- Left - Urgent 
	- Right - Not-Urgent

- Then: 
	- Do Top-Left, as they are Urgent & Important
	- Schedule Top-Right as they are Important
	- Delegate Bottom-left, as they are Urgent
	- Don't Do the bottom-right as they don't value.
