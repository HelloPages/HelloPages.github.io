- The hot hand fallacy is a [[Bias]] that a person with a successful outcome has a greater chance in the next attempt. 
- This bias is seen in sports, too; the word came from basketball. 
- While previous success at a task can indeed change the psychological attitude and increase a player's success rate, there is no logic to it.
- Kahneman in [[--BOOK- Thinking, Fast and Slow]]goes on to describe still more mental shortcomings, such as: 
	- Illusion of understanding: we think we know, and we make narratives to support what we know. 
	- Illusion of validity: some people make them look like they are expertise.
	- Expert intuition: algorithms, even seemingly primitive ones, applied with discipline often outdo experts.
	- [[--Over Confidence and Over Optimism]]
	- [[Hindsight bias]]
	- [[Confirmation bias]]
