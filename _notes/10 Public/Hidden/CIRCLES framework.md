The CIRCLES method is a problem-solving framework that helps product managers respond thoughtfully to any design question. CIRCLES means: 

- Comprehend
- Identify
- Report Needs
- Cut through Prioritization 
- List Solution
- Evaluate
- Summarize

- **Step 1. Comprehend** Team often lacks context. Provide them by focusing on four things. 
	- What is the problem we’re here to solve? 
	- Who has this problem? 
	- Why do we need to solve this problem now?
	- How we might tackle it. 

- **Step 2. Identify** Identify the ideal customer persona (one or more). [[You can’t build a product that works for everyone]]

- **Step 3. Report customer needs** Customers have real needs and problems; our job is to solve them. Using surveys and interactions, the product team should discover user needs and document them. JTBD (Job to Be Done)

- **Step 4. Cut through & prioritize needs** Plot JTBD maps on two dimensions.
	- How satisfied are customers with completing this job with our product (or the competitor's) today?
	-  How important getting the job done is to the user.
	- JTBD Matrix shows how essential and how satisfied customers are with completing those jobs.
	- Similar to [[Eisenhower Matrix]], if you focus on each quadrant, you will get a specific result: 
		- **Bottom-Right**: Attract users to the platform with little energy, and you can build a company that competes with bigger competitors with fewer resources simply by prioritizing more aggressively around unmet user needs.

- **Step 5. List solutions** Pick the job-to-be-done you are trying to work on and ask the team to list a range of possible solutions.

- **Step 6. Evaluate trade-offs** The best way to evaluate trade-offs is to look at two dimensions. What is the **impact** of this idea on our objectives, and how **complex** would this be to build?
- Engineers can contribute to the complexity part, also designers can provide crucial data insight on usability.
- The teams have to debate on these concepts at this point and argue the trade-offs through the lens of the objectives.
	- **What if two ideas sound good? ** 
		- In such cases, test with the user / try to get validation.
		- A/B is how we learn what to build a better product

- **Step 7. Provide a recommendation** Make a decision. The design team will work out how to make this idea _usable_ for the customer and will begin the design phase of the concept.
