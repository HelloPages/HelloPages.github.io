- As users spend most of their time on **other sites**. they prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know. 
- By using existing patterns and mental models, we can create superior user experiences were the users can focus on their tasks rather than on learning the pattern.
- When making changes, minimize discord by empowering users to continue using a familiar version for a limited time.
- Reduce learning curve, bring familiarity
