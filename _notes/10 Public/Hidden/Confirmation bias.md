Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that con*firms or supports one's prior beliefs or values.*

People display this bias when they select the information that supports their views, ignoring contrary information, or when they interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing attitudes. 

Due to [[What you see is all there is]], people will be quick to seize on limited evidence that confirms their existing perspective while ignoring seeking proof that is contrary.
