[[Lean UX]] follows a `build > test > iterate` loop, while [[Design Sprints]] follows `unpack > ideate > evaluate > test > refine` loop. Design Sprint is more about evaluation, while lean UX is about evolution.

There is a problem with lean UX that users are not very forgiving. Not all businesses can attempt Lean UX, as it's hard to gain back the trust once it's lost. Design sprint provides a user-validated draft, which provides better clarity on the backlog for design and development.
