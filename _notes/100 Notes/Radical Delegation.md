Once we have too many things in our plate, [[Eisenhower Matrix]] becomes less usable, as there are too many things to get done, even after delegating and deleting. Radical delegation is for tasks in two top quadrants of  Eisenhower Matrix - Do & Schedule. 

Assess each tasks in top two quadrants, and understand the the leverage (High/Low) and who could do this (Only You/Others)

- High Leverage + Only You
	- Focus Deeply
- High Leverage + Other
	- Delegate to the most suitable person
	- Monitor and work closely
- Low Leverage + Only You
	- Use it as an opportunity to coach teammate
	- Set a foundation and the coach, not vice versa
- Low Leverage + Others
	- Delegate and be available when then need

This provides a great chance to empower team members, and help them grow.
