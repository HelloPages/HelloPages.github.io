    Welcome to my working notes - a personal knowledge space made for learning and ideation. 
    It's a collection of atomic, deeply-linked, ever-growing notes that I keep updating as I gain more clarity over the topic. 
    If notes don't make much sense for you - I am sorry, and if it does make sense, do let me know your thoughts!
